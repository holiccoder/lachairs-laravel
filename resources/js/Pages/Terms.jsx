                        <p>
                            By accessing or using the Lachairs Commercial Products website and services, you
                            agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions. If you do not agree with any
                            part of these terms, you may not use our services. These terms apply to all
                            visitors, users, and business account holders.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-heading mt-10 mb-3">2. Business Account Registration</h2>
                        <p>
                            To access wholesale pricing and place orders, you must register for a business
                            account. You agree to provide accurate and complete information during the
                            registration process. Lachairs Commercial Products reserves the right to approve
                            or deny any business account application at its sole discretion. Account approval
                            typically occurs within 1 business day. You are responsible for maintaining the
                            confidentiality of your account credentials.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-heading mt-10 mb-3">3. Pricing &amp; Payment</h2>
                        <p>
                            All prices listed on the website are in U.S. dollars. Business account pricing is
                            visible only to approved account holders after logging in. Prices are subject to
                            change without notice. Payment terms for approved business accounts are net 30
                            days unless otherwise negotiated. We accept payment via ACH transfer, company
                            check, and major credit cards.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-heading mt-10 mb-3">4. Orders &amp; Fulfillment</h2>
                        <p>
                            All orders are subject to acceptance and availability. We reserve the right to
                            refuse or cancel any order. Order confirmations do not constitute acceptance; a
                            separate shipping confirmation will be sent once your order has been processed.
                            Lead times vary by product and quantity. Estimated ship dates are provided at the
                            time of order and are non-binding.

                        <p>
                            We ship to commercial addresses throughout the United States and Canada. Shipping
                            costs are calculated based on order size, weight, and destination. Freight
                            shipments require a loading dock or liftgate service (additional fees may apply).
                            Title and risk of loss pass to the buyer upon delivery to the carrier. Please
                            refer to our Shipping Information page for full details.
