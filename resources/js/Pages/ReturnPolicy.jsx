                            We accept returns on most products within 30 calendar days of delivery. To be
                            eligible for a return, products must be in their original packaging, unused, and
                            in resalable condition. Returns initiated after 30 days will not be accepted unless
                            covered under warranty.

                        <p>
                            Once your return is received and inspected, we will notify you of the approval or
                            rejection of your refund. Approved refunds will be processed within 5-10 business
                            days to the original method of payment. For business accounts on net terms, a
                            credit memo will be issued against your outstanding balance.

                        <p>
                            A restocking fee of 15% may apply to returns that are not the result of our error,
                            including orders placed incorrectly by the customer. This fee covers inspection,
                            repackaging, and inventory processing. Restocking fees will be deducted from your
                            refund amount.

                            or full refund at no cost to you and coordinate return shipping for the damaged
                            items if required.
